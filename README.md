# FitBit-Data-Analysis-with-R

This is my first analysis using R, based on the Bellabeat Case Study included in the Google Data Analytics Certificate. This project aims to explore trends in smart device usage and provide insights to support Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

You can find more details it on my [Kaggle profile ] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/yuliiazaikovska/bellabeat-case-study-using-r).

## Business Task
Analyze smart device usage trends to help Bellabeat, a high-tech company manufacturing health-focused smart products for women, improve their marketing strategy.

## Key Questions
1. What are current trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends be relevant to Bellabeat's customers?
3. How can these insights shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

## Dataset
- **Source**: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) from Kaggle
- **Contents**: Data from 30 Fitbit users including:
  - Minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring
  - Daily activity summaries (steps, calories, distance)
  - Sleep and sedentary behavior data

## Data Limitations
1. Small sample size (30 users)
2. Missing values in sleep and weight data
3. No gender information (critical for Bellabeat's female-focused products)

## Key Findings
- Only 32% of users met the 10,000 daily step goal
- 84% of activity time was light intensity
- Average of just 21 minutes of intense activity daily
- 44% of sleep observations fell below recommended 7 hours

## Recommendations
1. **Targeted Engagement**:
   - Tiered step goals (5K → 7.5K → 10K)
   - Sleep reminders 90 minutes before average bedtime
   
2. **Product Enhancements**:
   - Menstrual cycle-based activity suggestions
   - 5-minute workout routines for busy users

3. **Education**:
   - Guides on light activity benefits
   - Monthly sleep/activity correlation reports
